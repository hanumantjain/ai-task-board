### Current Milestone: Advanced Features Development

#### Ready for Development
1. **Task Input Form** - Next up
   - Rich form with title, description, deadline, duration, and task type selection
   - AI categorization request integration
   - Form validation with react-hook-form and zod

2. **Profile Management Section**
   - Weekly schedule editor (work/sleep/free hours by day)
   - Time block management with visual interface
   - Free time calculation and display

3. **AI Integration Enhancement**
   - Fix Gemini API schema types for function calling
   - Implement task categorization workflow
   - Build task suggestion engine for free time

## What's Working Now âœ…

### âœ… Functional Kanban Board
- **6 Columns**: Today, This Week, Important, Daily, Pending, Overdue
- **Drag & Drop**: Full React DnD implementation between columns
- **Task Cards**: Interactive cards with task details, badges, and actions
- **Local Storage**: Persistent task storage across browser sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

### âœ… Task Management System
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete tasks
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatic column assignment based on deadlines and importance
- **Task Ordering**: Drag-and-drop reordering within columns
- **Sample Data**: Pre-loaded examples to demonstrate functionality

### âœ… UI/UX Features
- **Modern Design**: Clean Chakra UI v3 interface with proper theming
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects, drag states, and transitions
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and loading states

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Task Input Form
```typescript
// Components to build:
- TaskInputCard component with rich form
- Form validation schema with zod
- Date/time picker integration
- Task type selection (Regular/Important)
- Duration input with smart suggestions
```

### Priority 2: Profile Section
```typescript
// Components to build:
- ProfileSchedule component
- DayScheduleEditor for each day
- TimeBlockInput component
- FreeTimeDisplay visualization
- Schedule persistence in localStorage
```

### Priority 3: AI Integration
```typescript
// Tasks to complete:
- Fix Gemini API schema type definitions
- Implement task categorization API calls
- Build task suggestion system
- Create AI settings panel
- Add loading states for AI operations
```

## Technical Architecture Status

### âœ… Completed Infrastructure
- **TypeScript Types**: Comprehensive type system for all data structures
- **Utility Functions**: Date/time handling, task operations, storage management
- **State Management**: Custom hooks with proper error handling
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable component design
- **Styling System**: Chakra UI v3 with responsive design patterns

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **Gemini API Integration**: Function calling schema needs type fixes
- **Form System**: react-hook-form integration pending
- **Profile Management**: Data structures ready, UI pending

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- **Advanced Features**: AI suggestions, smart scheduling
- **Performance**: Optimization and bundle analysis
- **Testing**: Component testing with Jest/RTL

## Questions Resolved âœ…
1. **Gemini API**: Structure created, needs API key setup in environment
2. **Data Persistence**: Using localStorage (easily upgradeable to backend later)
3. **Time Zone**: Using local time (can be enhanced later)
4. **Recurring Tasks**: Basic structure in place for daily tasks

## Risk Assessment Update
- **Low Risk**: Core UI components, basic task management âœ… DONE
- **Medium Risk**: Drag & drop implementation âœ… DONE, date/time calculations âœ… DONE
- **High Risk**: Gemini API integration complexity (in progress, schema types need fixing)

## Definition of Done âœ…
Each completed feature meets our criteria:
- [x] Functionality works as specified
- [x] TypeScript types are properly defined
- [x] Components are responsive and accessible
- [x] Integration with other components is tested
- [x] Error handling and loading states implemented

## User Experience Status
The app now provides:
- **Immediate Value**: Functional task board with drag-and-drop
- **Professional Feel**: Modern UI with smooth interactions
- **Clear Guidance**: Getting started instructions and feature explanations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ready for AI features when API key is added
