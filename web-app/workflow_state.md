# AI Task Board — Workflow State

## Current status: Core foundation complete ✅

### Completed
- [x] Next.js + TypeScript app scaffold
- [x] 4-column Kanban: Today, This Week, Upcoming, Overdue
- [x] Drag & drop with React DnD
- [x] Task cards, modals, edit/delete
- [x] LocalStorage persistence
- [x] Auth scaffolding and providers
- [x] Supabase client and DB layer scaffolding
- [x] Custom labels, timezone, and background settings (UI)

### In progress
- [ ] Gemini AI integration (categorization + suggestions)
- [ ] Task input form enhancements (React Hook Form + Zod)
- [ ] Profile scheduling UI
- [ ] Movement/ordering polish for columns
- [ ] Accessibility and mobile polish

### Next up (shortlist)
1. Wire up Gemini API and schema types
2. Document custom labels and scheduling
3. E2E tests and CI pipeline
4. Import/export tasks
5. Issue templates and labels

### What works now
- Drag-and-drop between all four columns
- Persistent tasks via LocalStorage
- Responsive layout with TailwindCSS
- Basic auth flows and global providers

### Tech snapshot
- Next.js, React, TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- React DnD, date-fns
- Supabase (client ready)

### Risks and watch-outs
- AI integration complexity and API schema drift
- Cross-timezone edge cases for deadlines/scheduling

### Definition of done
- Functionality verified with realistic data
- Strong TypeScript types in public APIs
- Accessible and responsive UI
- Errors and loading states handled
